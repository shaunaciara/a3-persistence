"List your contacts"
 http://a3-shaunasullivan.glitch.me

- helps to organize a person contacts w/ names and numbers
- your contacts are displayed in a table

challenges:
- lack of time to implement update button
- could not get current email of user from login page to have diff. data for each user

Yes- a Server, created using Express (no alternatives will be accepted for this assignment)
Yes - a Results functionality which shows the entire dataset residing in the server's memory
No - a Form/Entry functionality which allows users to add, modify, and delete data items (must be all three!) 
  - there is an add and delete functionality, but I did not have time to modify. I would have implemeted app.post('/update', function(req, res){ segment for the update button
Yes - Use of at least five Express middleware packages. Explore!
Yes - Basic authentication using the Passport middleware for Express (this counts as one of your five middleware packages). We encourage using the Local strategy, but OAuth (Open Authentication) can also be used for additional technical achievement. The course staff cannot help you with the various flavors of OAuth strategies. YOU MUST PROVIDE US WITH ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS TO LOGIN TO YOUR APPLICATION IF YOU USE OAUTH. The course staff cannot be expected to have credentials for any particular OAuth service.
Yes - Persistent data storage in between server sessions. lowdb is a suitable database package for this assignment and will be discussed in class.
Yes - Use of a CSS framework or template. This should do the bulk of your styling/CSS for you and be appropriate to your application. For example, don't use NES.css (which is awesome!) unless you're creating a game or some type of retro 80s site.

technical achivements:
- use of nodemon
- use of .ejs files
- use of jQuery
- email validation (must use a valid email for login/register)

design achicements:
-none implemented
